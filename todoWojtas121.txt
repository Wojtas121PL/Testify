Turn the project into testing platform for future employees
-Add exam groups and display only the exams that belong to users
-Rebuild the user management system:
    -All options like change email,password ect. should be displayed as separate panels for each user
    -DO NOT delete users. It will break the database. Instead, add disabled status.
-Changes for exam edit module:
    -In the main info section add duration option, per question. Example: 40 minutes
    -Make new type of exam. Instead of showing all questions at once, show them one after another.
     This will require an option to specify weather you can come back to previous question or not.

small improvements:
    -Change open question input to something less ugly
    -In the exam edit panel, display open questions in a better way

Bugs:
    -Unable to edit questions that have more or less than 4 answers, due to outdated Request validator
